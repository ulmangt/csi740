Problem 10.3

The error between mgs.m and the built-in MATLAB qr() command is provided below and is on the order of 1e-16.

The matrix produced by house.m appears significantly different. It is still a valid QR factorization as indicated by very small difference between the original A matrix and the QR matrix.

However, we note that if the less numerically stable Householder reflection vector is chosen, the resulting Q and R matricies are those prodiced by mgs.m and the MATLAB qr() command (with an error on the order of 1e-16).
